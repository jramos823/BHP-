# ARP P0ISON

This program poisons arp tables and allows you to be the middle man inbetween attacks. 
<br> This is done by poisoning the arp tables of The specified Target and Specified Router (spoofIP)
<br> You can mess around with port forwarding on your machine. As of right now this has only been tested on Linux but..
<br> Tested with Windows 10.

<br>Created using Python3.
<br>I had some help using Scapy. A packet manipulation module. https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html
<br>This was made for educational purposes only.
<br>Works across all platforms. Python2.7 , and Python3 compatible.
<br>Might need to run a pip(3) install scapy.
