# Read me 

Created using Python3.
<br> I had some help using Scapy. A packet manipulation module. https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html
<br> This was made for educational purposes only.
<br> Works across all platforms. Python2.7 , and Python3 compatible.
<br> Might need to run a pip(3) install scapy.
